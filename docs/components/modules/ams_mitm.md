# ams_mitm
This module provides methods to intercept services provided by other system modules. It is further sub-divided according to the service it targets.

## bpc_mitm
bpc_mitm enables intercepting requests to power control services. It currently intercepts:
+ "am" system module (to intercept the Reboot/Power buttons in the overlay menu)
+ "fatal" system module (to simplify payload reboot logic significantly)
+ Homebrew Loader (to allow homebrew to take advantage of the feature)

## fs_mitm
fs_mitm enables intercepting file system operations. It can log, deny, delay, replace, or redirect any request made to the file system. It enables LayeredFS to function, which allows for replacement of game assets.

## hid_mitm
hid_mitm enables intercepting requests to controller device services. It currently intercepts:
+ Homebrew Loader (to help homebrew not need to be recompiled due to a breaking change introduced in the past)

## ns_mitm
ns_mitm enables intercepting requests to application control services. It currently intercepts:
+ Web Applets (to facilitate hbl web browser launching)

## set_mitm
set_mitm enables intercepting requests to the system settings service. It currently intercepts:
+ "ns" system module and games (to allow for overriding game locales)
+ All settings requests

### Firmware Version
set_mitm intercepts the `GetFirmwareVersion` command, if the requester is `qlaunch` or `maintenance`.
It modifies the `display_version` field of the returned system version, causing the version to display
in settings as `#.#.# (AMS #.#.#)`. This allows users to easily verify what version of Atmosph√®re they are running.

### System Settings
set_mitm intercepts the `GetSettingsItemValueSize` and `GetSettingsItemValue` commands for all requesters.
It does so in order to enable user configuration of system settings, which are parsed from `/atmosphere/system_settings.ini` on boot. See [here](../../features/configurations.md) for more information on the system settings format.
